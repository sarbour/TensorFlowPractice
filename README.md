This repository contains code referenced from the textbook *AI and Machine Learning for Coders: A Programmer's Guide to Artificial Intelligence*.

I intend to work through the coded examples provided in the textbook as well as add additional tweaks to better/deepen my understanding of ML & AI topics.
